# Base ERC-20 Contract

This contract is the next iteration of [Drew Roberts](https://github.com/drewroberts) tokenomics for [Tipoff](https://github.com/tipoff) releases. It builds on the success of the [ApeHaven](https://github.com/apehaven) project and adds additional flexibility with reduced gas fees. It is the new base structure for future projects led by [Drew Roberts](https://drewroberts.com) and the [Tipoff](https://tipoff.com) Team.
